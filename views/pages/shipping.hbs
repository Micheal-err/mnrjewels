      <h3 class="primary-text">Delivery Coverage</h3>
      <p>
        We deliver to all and any postal address across India. Customers are
        requested to provide a complete and accurate street address along with
        the correct PIN code / ZIP code.
      </p>

      <p>
        To ensure the quickest confirmed delivery, please make sure the shipping
        address entered at checkout is complete and correct. We shall not be
        responsible for delays caused due to incomplete or incorrect address
        details.
      </p>

      <p>
        All shipments to Colleges, Schools, or Hostels are placed strictly at the
        customer’s risk. If the package is refused or not accepted by the
        institution’s authorities, <strong>mnrjewels.com</strong> will not issue
        any refund or credit under any circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        For preferred or special delivery dates, customers must clearly mention
        the delivery date in the gift message box while placing the order. If no
        delivery date is specified, the order will be dispatched and delivered at
        the earliest available opportunity.
      </p>

      <h3 class="primary-text">Incorrect or Incomplete Address</h3>
      <p>
        Some courier companies impose penalties for incorrect or mismatched
        shipping addresses and PIN codes. Any such penalties or additional fees
        will be borne entirely by the customer and not by
        <strong>mnrjewels.com</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case a reshipment is required for the same order, customers will be
        responsible for paying the reshipping charges.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an incorrect or incomplete address is provided and the package is
        lost, misplaced, or undelivered, <strong>mnrjewels.com</strong> shall not
        be responsible and will not initiate any refund, replacement, or credit
        under any circumstances.
      </p>

      <h3 class="primary-text">Shipment & Tracking Details</h3>
      <p>
        Once your order is dispatched, you will receive an email containing the
        courier details, tracking number, and the expected delivery date.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Tracking information will only be shared once the
        order has been dispatched. After dispatch, M&R Jewels will not be
        responsible for delivery delays as we do not have control over courier
        operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        No additional shipment-related information can be provided beyond the
        tracking details shared.
      </p>

      <h3 class="primary-text">Time to Dispatch</h3>
      <p>
        Dispatch timelines mentioned on the website are indicative and
        approximate. Delays may occur due to circumstances beyond our control.
        No refund, return, replacement, or exchange requests will be entertained
        on this basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under normal conditions, orders are dispatched within <strong>2–3
        working days</strong>, and delivery is completed within
        <strong>7–10 working days</strong> after dispatch.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Delivery timelines may vary depending on PIN code,
        remote locations, weather conditions, or courier service limitations.
        Some areas may experience longer delivery durations.
